# TypeScript Merge Function Project

This project includes a TypeScript implementation of a `merge` function that merges two sorted arrays into one sorted array without using any built-in sort functions. It also includes unit tests written with Jest.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed on your machine.

## Setup

To set up the project, clone the repository and install the dependencies.

```bash
git clone 
cd typescript-merge-function
npm install
