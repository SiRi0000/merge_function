# TypeScript Merge Function Project

This project includes a TypeScript implementation of a `merge` function that merges two sorted arrays into one sorted array without using any built-in sort functions. It also includes unit tests written with Jest.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed on your machine.

## Setup

To set up the project, clone the repository and install the dependencies.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SiRi0000/merge_function.git
cd merge-function
npm install
```

## Compiling TypeScript

Compile the TypeScript files to JavaScript using the TypeScript compiler.

```bash
npx tsc
```

## Run the code

To run the merged function code, you will need to create a script or execute it from a TypeScript file that imports the `merge` function. This instruction assumes you are running the function from within a TypeScript file.

## Running Unit Tests

This project uses Jest for unit testing. To run the tests, execute the following command:

```bash
npm test
```
